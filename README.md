# Unity Balloon Game 🎈

A 3D balloon floating game built in Unity where players navigate through a town collecting money tokens while avoiding bombs.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- **Balloon Physics:** Hold spacebar to float upward, release to fall
- **Scrolling Background:** Seamless horizontal scrolling simulation
- **Dynamic Spawning:** Random bombs and money tokens appear continuously
- **Particle Effects:** Fireworks for money collection, explosions for bombs
- **Sound Effects:** Audio feedback for all interactions
- **Boundaries:** Height limits with ground bounce physics
- **Game Over State:** Background stops when collision occurs

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

- ✅ Player movement controls (Rigidbody assignment)
- ✅ Background scrolling logic (inverted condition fix)
- ✅ Object spawning system (method name typo fix)
- ✅ Particle positioning (dynamic location updates)
- ✅ Background repeat mechanics (width calculation fix)
- ✅ Height boundaries (ceiling and floor limits)
- ✅ Bounce physics (game state awareness)

## 🎯 Controls

- **Spacebar:** Hold to float balloon upward
- **Release Spacebar:** Balloon falls due to gravity

## 🏗️ Built With

- Unity 3D
- C# Scripting
- Physics System
